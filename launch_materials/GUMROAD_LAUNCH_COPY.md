# GUMROAD LAUNCH COPY - ALLELE

## Product Title
**ALLELE: The Phylogenic Agent SDK**

## Subtitle
Beyond Prompt Engineering. Evolve Genetically Optimized Personalities with Liquid Memory.

---

## THE HOOK (First 3 Lines - Critical!)

Traditional Agents are brittle. They hallucinate, drift, and forget.

**Phylogenic changes the substrate.**

We replaced static prompts with **8-Trait Genetic Code** and **Liquid Neural Networks (LNNs)**.

**Don't write prompts. Breed Agents.**

---

## PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

### The Problem You're Solving

Prompting is guessing. You tweak one word, the entire personality breaks. Vector stores give you retrieval, but no temporal coherence. Fine-tuning costs thousands and takes weeks.

**You've been building agents wrong.**

### The Solution (What Phylogenic Does)

Phylogenic treats AI Agent personalities like **DNA, not text.**

Instead of brittle system prompts, you define a **Genome** with 8 quantified traits:

- Empathy (0-1)
- Technical Knowledge (0-1)
- Creativity (0-1)
- Conciseness (0-1)
- Context Awareness (0-1)
- Engagement (0-1)
- Adaptability (0-1)
- Personability (0-1)

Then you:
1. **Evolve** them using Genetic Algorithms (automatic optimization)
2. **Stabilize** their context with Kraken Liquid Neural Networks (temporal memory)
3. **Deploy** them across any LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)

### Why This Matters

✅ **Reproducible**: Same genome = same personality (version control for agents!)
✅ **Evolvable**: Run 50 variants, breed the best (like A/B testing on steroids)
✅ **Explainable**: Trait values = why your agent behaves that way
✅ **LLM-Agnostic**: Works with GPT-4, Claude, local Ollama models
✅ **Fast**: Crossover in <5ms, LNN processing in <10ms

## FAQs

**Q: Is this just another LLM wrapper?**
A: No. Phylogenic is a genome-based personality framework. The LLM is just the "brain" - Phylogenic provides the personality layer.

**Q: Do I need to fine-tune models?**
A: No! Genomes work with any LLM out of the box (GPT-4, Claude, Ollama).

**Q: How is this different from prompt engineering?**
A: Prompts are strings. Genomes are data structures that can be versioned, evolved, and composed.

**Q: Can I use local models (Ollama)?**
A: Yes! Phylogenic is LLM-agnostic. Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, or custom endpoints.

**Q: What if I'm not a Python expert?**
A: If you can `pip install` and run basic Python, you're good. Examples are copy-paste ready.

**Q: Is the evolution actually useful or just marketing?**
A: Real benchmarks: 50 genomes, 20 generations, fitness function = your success metric. It finds optima you wouldn't guess.

**Q: How long does evolution take?**
A: Depends on your fitness function. If testing = 1 min/genome, 50 agents × 20 generations = ~16 hours. But it runs automatically.

**Q: Can I sell agents I build with this?**
A: YES! MIT license. No restrictions on commercial use.
